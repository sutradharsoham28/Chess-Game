What Features have been added:-

1. Not only the Black pieces, but also the White pieces get instantiated onto the Game Scene now.
2. You can now change the position of the pieces(both white and black), even while the game is in Play Mode.
3. Two types of Highlighted Prefabs were implemented: Green Highlight(for all possible moves of a piece)
						      Red Highlight(for all captures available to a piece).

(No feature for movement of pieces was added, as stated in the assignment description.)
